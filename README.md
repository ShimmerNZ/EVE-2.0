# Animatronic EVE

This project contains the updated files for the redesign of EVE. The original project was limited by what I could do with Tinkercad a few years back, this version was done using Fusion360 which I just started using. The model is designed to resemble rather than being screen accurate.

A full Instruction file has been provided.
